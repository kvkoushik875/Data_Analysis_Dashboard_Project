# **Interactive Excel Dashboard for Hotel Booking Data Analysis**
**Project Objective:**
To analyze hotel booking and cancellation data using Microsoft Excel in order to identify booking patterns, cancellation trends, and key factors influencing cancellations, and to present actionable insights through an interactive dashboard for data-driven decision-making.
## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/kvkoushik875/Data_Analysis_Dashboard_Project/blob/main/Hotel_booking_cancellation_dashboard.xlsx">Dataset</a>

## Key Questions Answered by the Dashboard
- What is the overall booking vs cancellation rate?
- Which hotel type (City Hotel vs Resort Hotel) has a higher cancellation rate?
- How does lead time affect the likelihood of cancellation?
- Which customer segments (Transient, Group, Contract) cancel the most?
- What is the impact of deposit type on booking cancellations?
- Which market segments contribute most to total bookings and cancellations?
- How do monthly and seasonal trends influence booking demand and cancellations?
- Which room types experience the highest number of cancellations?
- How do repeated guests vs new guests differ in cancellation behavior?
- What are the top factors driving cancellations, and where can improvements be made?

# Project Insights
- City Hotels experience a higher cancellation rate compared to Resort Hotels, indicating greater booking uncertainty in urban locations.
- Bookings with longer lead times show a significantly higher likelihood of cancellation.
- Reservations made without a deposit have the highest cancellation percentage, while refundable and non-refundable deposits reduce cancellations.
- Transient customers contribute the majority of total bookings as well as cancellations.
- Repeat guests are less likely to cancel compared to first-time guests, showing higher customer loyalty.
- Seasonal trends reveal peak booking volumes during specific months, with cancellations also increasing during high-demand periods.

# Final Conclusion
- The Hotel Booking & Cancellation Analysis Dashboard successfully demonstrates how Microsoft Excel can be used to transform raw hotel booking data into valuable business insights. Through effective data cleaning, KPI calculation, and interactive visualization, the dashboard highlights key patterns in customer behavior and cancellation trends. This analysis enables hotel management to identify high-risk segments, optimize booking policies, and improve revenue management strategies. The project showcases practical data analytics skills, including data preparation, pivot table analysis, and dashboard design, making it suitable for data analyst roles, internships, and academic evaluation.
